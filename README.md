# Pytorch Notebooks Repository
Welcome to my Torch Noteboks repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebook and code related to deep learning project using Pytorch

 **.**PyTorch is a deep learning framework that offers a dynamic computational graph, making
it well-suited for building and training neural networks. In the next-word prediction
model, PyTorch is utilized to define the architecture of the neural network
(LexiconModel) and to perform training and inference operations. The model learns the
probability distribution of the next word given the current word, which is crucial for
generating predictions.
## Overview
In this repository, you will find notebooks and code examples covering a wide range of topics related to deep learning and PyTorch, including:
1. **Creating a Lexicon:** The project demonstrates by processing a training dataset and
identifying word transitions to construct a lexicon. Each word in the lexicon is linked to a
list of words along with their occurrence frequencies thereby capturing the patterns of
word sequences in the data.

2. **Assisting Text Input:** Offering real-time suggestions while users are typing enhancing
the efficiency and accuracy of text input in applications like messaging platforms
document editors and search engines.

3. **Language Modeling:**Understanding and modeling the structure and patterns of
language from textual data facilitating applications, like machine translation, speech
recognition, and natural language comprehension.

4. **Enhancing User Experience:** Boosting typing efficiency by recommending the word
reducing the time and effort needed for inputting text.

5. **Enhancing Precision:** Developing algorithms that can accurately forecast the word
based on context enhancing the relevance and utility of suggestions.
